          This was one of my first web applications that I developed using the Spring Framework. I wanted to create an app that tracked Covid cases in multiple countries around the world. Using a dataset found on Github, I developed this app that would make requests to the repo when needed to get the most recent Covid cases, then display it on the website.
          
          I was able to learn a lot of how to make HTTP requests using Java's HTTP Client API. To display the information, I utiized Thymeleaf pages with HTML/CSS and javascript.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
